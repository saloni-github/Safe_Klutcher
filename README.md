# Safe_Klutcher

Safe Klutcher is a random key generation encryption tool for local valuable files in computer. The tool helps us to identify possible suspects and logs data of the time of data breaches that happen.<br/><br/>
The tool will ask for two options: <br/>
A. If you want to encrypt a file select option A. Then you will be asked for the path of the file. As soon as u give the path your file will be encrypted and a randomly generated password will be provided. Keep this password safe as this is the only way to decrypt your files back.<br/>
B. If you want to open an earlier encrypted file select option B. Then you will be asked for the password string. Enter the password. And your file is decrypted.
